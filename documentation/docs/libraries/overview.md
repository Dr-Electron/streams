# IOTA Streams libraries

The following bindings to the Streams libraries are currently available:

- [Rust](rust/overview) 
- [Wasm](wasm/overview) 
- [C](c/overview) 

## Getting Started

The recommended approach to start your interactions with IOTA is to use a test network. A public API load balancer is provided here: [https://api.lb-0.testnet.chrysalis2.com:443](https://api.lb-0.testnet.chrysalis2.com:443)

The test network explorer is available at the [IOTA Tangle explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/testnet).
